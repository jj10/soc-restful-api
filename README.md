# Summer of Code: RESTful API with Node and Express

Welcome to the first installment of the summer of code. This tutorial is the first in a series meant to introduce you to some key concepts that you may come across throughout your career as a front-end developer.

* [Session I: RESTful API](http://github.com/hacktaros/soc-restful-api)
* Session II: Backbone
* Session III: Ember
* Session IV: Angular

You will be using what we learned here in future tutorials to go over the major differences between these front-end javascript libraries and how you can use them in future projects.

## Prequisites
1. Download and install [Node](http://nodejs.org).
2. Download and install the [Cocoa Rest Client](https://code.google.com/p/cocoa-rest-client/) for Mac. 

That's pretty much it. You should be all ready to go!

## What is the deal with RESTful API?
You can read so much on this on the internet, but the most important part for this tutorial is the acronym, CRUD.
